# Ubuntu-VPN-Setup.sh
L2TP/IPsec (VPN) Auto Install Script for Ubuntu 14.04 Amazon Web Services EC2


Could be used as a Amazon EC2 user-data file for automatic configuration of IPsec/L2TP VPN
on a Ubuntu server instance. Tested with 14.04 (Trusty) 
With minor modifications, this script *can also be used* on dedicated servers
or any KVM- or XEN-based Virtual Private Server (VPS) from other providers or Linode.

 DO NOT RUN THIS SCRIPT ON YOUR PC OR MAC! THIS IS MEANT TO BE RUN WHEN 
 YOUR AMAZON EC2 INSTANCE STARTS!

I also included the ending arguments that block torrent downloading.
